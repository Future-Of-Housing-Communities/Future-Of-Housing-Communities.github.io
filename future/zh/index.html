					Post-2020, how we work, live, and engage with our others has rapidly transformed. Previous developer-driven models do not account for these new lifestyles or these accelerated time frames. This crucial moment in history will have a lasting impact on our ecological footprint. Society reacts in an emergency, as it should; however, this is also a moment to reflect: Are we respectful, responsible, sustainable, and helpful? Traditionally, cities evolved over hundreds and thousands of years, flourishing into an intricate ecosystem. Time is no longer a luxury we can afford. Society, and the planet, can no longer endure an evolutionary process of trial and error. We have to get it right the first time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Humanity is changing rapidly, and consequently, so is our planet. Global society is now a complex web in which virtual and physical spaces are intricately interwoven. Citizens shop from home, work from home, educate their children at home, but we long for “pack life” and the promise of travel, along with its small annoyances and discomforts. This calls for a redefinition of ‘home’ within a community, designs that bring balance between disparate aspects of public and private life. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Participants will be tasked with reimagining the tools needed to create future communities and the redefinition of home. This toolkit should answer important questions, but it should also formulate questions that are not being asked of us yet. The competition will focus on post-pandemic modes of city life fusing education, health, technology, art, ecology, activism, and entrepreneurship.

					“in practice master plans fail...they are too rigid; they cannot easily adapt to the natural and unpredictable changes that inevitably arise in the life of a community.”

				</p>
				<p>
					We invite you to rethink urban and architectural design. Share in the conversation and help craft communities of the future. The challenge is to explore elegant, efficient, and dynamic concepts that strike a balance between live, work, play while incorporating sustainable technologies that leverage robotics, modular design, prefabrication, and eco-friendly materials.
